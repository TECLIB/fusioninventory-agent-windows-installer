2.4.2 Tue, 03 Oct 2018
agent:
* FusionInventory Agent 2.4.2 (commit: f7767abfdb | date: oct 03 2018)
* Fix physical memory error correction detection via WMI under win32
* Fix #299: Added UWP/APPX/Windows Store software inventory
* win32 antivirus detection enhanced support:
  - add support for few antivirus base versions (defender, kaspersky,
    EST, avira, MSE, McAfee, F-Secure)
  - try to set license expiration date for F-Secure, kaspersky & avira
* Fix #442: kaspersky not fully recognized in russia
* Fix #501: wrong status was reported when windows defender was disabled
* Bump Deploy task version to 2.7
* Fix deployment of private packages: their downloaded parts were not
  fully found when download were too long (closes: #542)
* Handle retention duration differently for p2p and not p2p files
* P2p files have a default retention of 3 days by default
* P2p files have a default retention of 3 times the target prolog delay
  after download, parts retention is reset to the same delay for all file parts,
  so the retention duration applies at the time parts has been downloaded
* P2p file parts are now cleaned up after job success if retention duration
  is null
* Fix WinKeyNotEquals audit check to also be true when the registry key is
  simply missing
* Add support to "startjob" key for failing deploy audit check to permit
  to skip remaining checks when a failing condition makes them obsolete.
* Bump ESX task version to 2.4
* Support 2 ServiceTags case to cover chassis & lame board S/N inventory
* Updated AssetTag support
* fix wrong cpu core computation when only one package is available
* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 2.7
* Bump NetInventory task version to 3.1
* Thanks to @QuickNerd357, Brocade devices will now show serial number and
  firmware informations.
* Sanitize VLAN names. This fixes an issue with Cisco Small Business Switches.
* Get rid of unofficial Net::Ping::TimeStamp support to only use official
  support if available. Net::Ping v2.67 is now mandatory to discover
  devices thanks to timestamp ping.
* Fix #481: Add Synology NAS support
* Fix #480: Add CheckPoint support
* Fix #488: Update HP Printers support
* Updated LLDP/CDP connection match checks
* Updated sysobject.ids (tagged fia-2.4.2 tag on github repository)
* Bump Collect task version to 2.5
* Thanks to David Durieux, add support for dynamic pattern in registry key
  collect under win32. The dynamic pattern is '**' to glob subkeys like in:
  HKEY_USERS/**/Software/**/**/CurrentVersion
* Bump Maintenance task version to 1.1
* Disable Maintenance task if no maintenance module could be used

core:
* Register service with folders to include to avoid conflicts from any other
  local perl install
* Update PCI IDs database (pci.ids file) to 2018.10.02
* Update USB IDs database (usb.ids file) to 2018.08.15

2.4.1 Tue, 03 Jul 2018
agent:
* FusionInventory Agent 2.4.1 (commit: 7c7db6661f | date: jun 29 2018)
* Don't try to run dmidecode inventories if it returns no output. Under
  windows, this will fix few cases switching them to WMI based inventory.
* Add PowerSupplies support

* Fix #500: Add Acer monitor EDID id match
* Better SQL Server software inventory under win32
* Bump Deploy task version to 2.6
* Fix file retention support using the new Maintenance task
* Add P2P peers caching to reduce peers discovery load in the meantime
* Reduced timeout for peer discovery and file parts downloading for P2P. This
  efficiently limits the time passed to discover the local peers and disqualify
  any busy or not responding peers in a more acceptable delay.
* For better P2P support, agent ajusts its 404 message to "Nothing found" when it
  has nothing to share with other agents. So peers won't ask again and again for
  any file part during 20 minutes by default.
* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 2.6
* Bump NetInventory task version to 3.0
* Many fix and enhancements for NetDiscovery & NetInventory tasks, see
  the agent Changes file for details
